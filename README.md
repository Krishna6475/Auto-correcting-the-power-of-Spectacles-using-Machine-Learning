# Auto-Adjustment of Spectacles Power

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning to automatically adjust the power of spectacles based on real-time sensor data. The system predicts the ideal focal length based on a clarity score, allowing for real-time adjustment of spectacles for optimal vision.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to create a smart spectacle system that uses machine learning to analyze real-time data, such as the clarity score, and adjusts the spectacles' focal length accordingly. The system uses a **Linear Regression** model trained on simulated sensor data, which predicts the best focal length for clear vision. 

The application is built using **Streamlit** for the user interface and **joblib** for model loading and prediction. The app allows users to input their clarity score and get a predicted focal length that the system would adjust the spectacles to. 

## Features

- **Real-time focal length prediction**: Based on a clarity score input by the user.
- **Automatic adjustment**: The system simulates adjusting the spectacles to the predicted focal length.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with **Streamlit** to allow seamless user interaction.
- **Model loading**: Uses a pre-trained model to predict focal length adjustments based on clarity score input.

## Project Architecture

- **Streamlit**: Used to create the user interface.
- **Linear Regression Model**: Trained on synthetic data to predict focal lengths based on clarity scores.
- **joblib**: Used to load and save the trained model.
